# WetQual-GUI
This  Graphical  User  Interfaces  (GUI)  was developed  for  the  Wetland  Water  Quality  Model, WetQual. The process-based WetQual model  simulates  nitrogen  (N),  phosphorus  (P),  total  suspended  sediment  (TSS)  and  carbon  (C)  cycles  and  their  dynamics  in  wetlands.  The  model  partitions  a  wetland  into  three  basic  compartments:  (1)  (free)  water  column,  (2)  wetland  soil  layer,  which  is  further  portioned  into  aerobic and anaerobic zones, and (3) plant biomass.

    4) Example projects for deterministic and stochastic models are provided in the fourth link.

    5) The user needs to install “MATLAB® Compiler Runtime R2017a”, if this version of MATLAB is not installed on the user’s computer. The Compiler software is provided in the fifth link. It can be also downloaded from MATLAB website (https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). Please make sure that you select “R2017a” version. 
You don’t have to install MATLAB Runtime software if you don’t run Sensitivity Analysis, BMCML, and Forecasting modules.

More detail information can be found in the User Manual.
