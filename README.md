# WetQual-GUI

This  Graphical  User  Interfaces  (GUI)  was developed  for  the  Wetland  Water  Quality  Model, WetQual. The process-based WetQual model  simulates  nitrogen  (N),  phosphorus  (P),  total  suspended  sediment  (TSS)  and  carbon  (C)  cycles  and  their  dynamics  in  wetlands.  The  model  partitions  a  wetland  into  three  basic  compartments:  (1)  (free)  water  column,  (2)  wetland  soil  layer,  which  is  further  portioned  into  aerobic and anaerobic zones, and (3) plant biomass.
